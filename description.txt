 The chat app has been made using
1> express js
2> javascript
3> css
4> react js
5> socket.io

The first interface we see is the joining page where a dialog box appear to insert the name and click on join. 
After the joining we can see our name on top left corner and at bottom space for typing message and a send button.
I have used socket.io for too and fro connection between the client and server and code can be found in server. js
